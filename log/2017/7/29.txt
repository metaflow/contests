atcoder regular 079 and lunchtime
goal: all but one at atcoder, 3 in lunchtime
result: 3 in atcoder, 3 in lunchtime. Got into weeds in graph problem in atcoder. Spent too much time with relatively simple one in luchtime - I have started implementing so much complex solution and only after a while noticed that there is much simplier way to solve it. Was a bit shy to go straight to NlogN for second one though upsolving showed that was a correct approach.
takeaway:
- upsolve last from atcoder round (check analysis)
- spent more time on analysis and conter examples (maybe fixed timer? 5 minutes lost in more analysis is better then 20 on wrong implementation)
- would be so nice to have a test case creator
