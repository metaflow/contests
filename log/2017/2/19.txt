codeforces 359.E
I was mentally prepared for hard problem and really turned it into hard one :)
Major error was to skip troughful analysis and after draft solution w/o any
real checking it go straight to implementation. While it might be OK to skip
really boring parts but not an analysis itself.
Solution turned out to get ML and WA in different places of code.
Rewritten solution is two times faster, AC from first try and 3 times shorter.
