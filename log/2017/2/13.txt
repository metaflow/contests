Tried to solve practice problem from hashcode:
- copying in memory is slow, better to use shared ptr to move things around
- evolution algorithms are not so complicated but still take a lot of time
-> it's worth trying to solve another problem with this approach (or see that I need something entirily different
- python and repl looks too hard for me - every typo is uncovered only after a while

- easy but writing down high level solution allows to get everthing in order
