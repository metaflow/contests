INTERVALS
- misread problem statement (intervals strictly included, it doesn't affect complexity but still a requirement)
- fill of big array of nontrivial value is actually for loop operation
- for DP it's worth checking cost of computing single entry. e.g. in this problem there is 6e7 states but computing each of them could take around e5 totalling e12
-> it might worth to recording process of solving the problem
- spent considerable time trying to optimize small details which was not relevant at all
- several off by one errors
- error in used variable (n instead of m) -> name variables meaningfully
