PROBLEM STATEMENT
Bear Limak and deer Evil have N cookies with various flavors.
Cookies are numbered 0 through N-1.
Bears and deer are natural enemies so Limak and Evil don't want to eat together.
They decided to divide cookies by playing a simple game.
They will alternately take one cookie.
Limak starts.
The game ends when there are no more cookies.

As you can guess, bears and deer prefer different flavors.
The i-th cookie has value A[i] for Limak and value B[i] for Evil.
We define Limak's score as sum of A[i] of his cookies and Evil's score as sum of B[i] of his cookies.

Limak knows his opponent's strategy.
Evil always takes a cookie with the biggest B[i].
In case of tie he takes a cookie with the biggest A[i] (from cookies with the biggest B[i]).

Limak wants to maximize the difference between his and Evil's score.
Help him and find the maximum possible value of L-E, where L denotes Limak's score and E denotes Evil's score.

The description of cookies is provided in the form of a pseudorandom generator.
You are given the ints N, R, C, D, A_MAX, and B_MAX.
As defined above, N is the number of cookies.
The flavors of cookies are generated by the pseudocode below.
Watch out for integer overflow when implementing it.


for i between 0 and N-1, inclusive:
    R = (C * R + D) modulo (10^9+7);
    A[i] = R % A_MAX;
    R = (C * R + D) modulo (10^9+7);
    B[i] = R % B_MAX;


Note that A[i] will be between 0 and A_MAX-1, inclusive.
And B[i] will be between 0 and B_MAX-1, inclusive.

DEFINITION
Class:BearEats
Method:getDifference
Parameters:int, int, int, int, int, int
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long getDifference(int N, int R, int C, int D, int A_MAX, int B_MAX)


NOTES
-N will be between 1 and 200,000, inclusive.

Returns: -3

A = {6,2,4}, B = {9,14,4}.
Limak should take the second cookie - (2,14).
It has value A[i]=2 for him.
Evil wants a cookie with the bigest B[i] so he takes (6,9).
Limak can take the last cookie (4,4) and his score is 2+4=6.
Evil's score is 9 so difference is 6-9 = -3.
Limak can't achieve a better difference.

Returns: 4

A = {6, 12, 10, 6, 12}, B = {18, 2, 18, 2, 18}.
Optimal start for Limak is to take the cookie (12,18).
There are two cookies with the biggest B[i] now and Evil takes the one with bigger A[i] - (10, 18).
Limak takes (6,18), Evil (12,2) and Limak (6,2).
Limak has score 12+6+6 = 24.
Evil has score 18+2 = 20.

Evil wants first cookie and the last one and Limak should allow him to do it.
Limak ends with score 737687500 + 715072124 and Evil with 2859 + 2749.
