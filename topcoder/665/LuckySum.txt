PROBLEM STATEMENT

A lucky number is a positive integer such that each of its digits is a 4 or a 7.
A lucky sum is the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) lucky numbers.
Cat loves lucky sums!



Cat has a string note.
Each character in note is either a digit or a question mark.
A number matches note if it can be produced from note by changing each question mark to a single digit.
Note that the number produced this way must not have any leading zeros: after the changes, note[0] must be between '1' and '9', inclusive.



Find and return the smallest lucky sum that matches note.
If there are no lucky sums that match note, return -1.
