PROBLEM STATEMENT
Limak is an old brown bear who likes to play darts.

Limak just picked up an empty scorecard.
He then threw a sequence of darts into a dartboard and for each dart he recorded the point value of the area it hit.
You are given a vector <int> w containing the contents of Limak's scorecard: a sequence of point values.

Today there is a special jackpot.
In order to win the jackpot, the player must present a scorecard with exactly four scores: (a, b, c, d).
Additionally, these scores must be such that a*c = b*d.
Note that order matters: the scores a, b, c, d must have been obtained in this particular order.

Limak wants to erase all but four scores from his scorecard in such a way that he will win the jackpot.
Compute and return the number of different ways in which he can do that.

DEFINITION
Class:BearDarts
Method:count
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long count(vector <int> w)


CONSTRAINTS
-w will contain between 4 and 1000 elements, inclusive.
-Each element in w will be between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{6,8,4,3,6}

Returns: 2

Limak must present a scorecard with four scores, so here he has to erase exactly one of these five scores.
There are two ways to do that and win the jackpot: he can erase either the first throw or the last throw.
If he erases the first throw, he will be left with (a,b,c,d) = (8,4,3,6), and indeed 8*3 = 4*6.
If he erases the last throw, he will be left with (a,b,c,d) = (6,8,4,3), and we have 6*4 = 8*3.

1)
{3,4,12,1}

Returns: 0

Limak cannot erase anything, so the only thing he can try is to present this scorecard without any changes.
However, 3*12 does not equal 4*1, so he won't win the jackpot.

2)
{42,1000000,1000000,42,1000000,1000000}

Returns: 3

In this case there are three valid solutions:

Erase the elements with 0-based indices 4 and 5.
Erase the elements with 0-based indices 1 and 2.
Erase the elements with 0-based indices 0 and 3.


3)
{1,1,1,1,1}

Returns: 5

Here, Limak can erase any single score.
Note that the five ways are considered different, even though they all produce a scorecard with four 1s.

4)
{1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1}

Returns: 22



5)
{33554432, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728}

Returns: 0
