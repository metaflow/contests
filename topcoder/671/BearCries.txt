PROBLEM STATEMENT
Limak is a polar bear who often chats online with his friends.
Nowadays, bears often use emoticons to express their feelings.
In this problem we consider one particular emoticon: the crying emoticon.

A crying emoticon consists of an arbitrary positive number of underscores between two semicolons.
Hence, the shortest possible crying emoticon is ";_;" (quotes for clarity).
The strings ";__;" and ";_____________;" are also valid crying emoticons.

Today Limak is sad, so he sent his friend a sequence of crying emoticons.
However, due to a network malfunction all those emoticons got mixed together into a single string.

You are given a string message containing the message Limak's friend received.
You guess that the message can be divided into one or more crying emoticons.
Each emoticon must be a subsequence of the message, and each character of the message must belong to exactly one emoticon.
Note that the subsequences are not required to be contiguous.

Let X be the number of ways in which one can divide the given message into emoticons.
Compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).

DEFINITION
Class:BearCries
Method:count
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(string message)


CONSTRAINTS
-message will contain between 1 and 200 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in message will be either semicolon or underscore.


EXAMPLES

0)
";_;;_____;"

Returns: 2

There are two ways to divide this string into two crying emoticons.
One looks as follows:

 ;_;
    ;_____;

and the other looks like this:

 ;_ ;
   ; _____;


1)
";;;___;;;"

Returns: 36

This message consists of 3 semicolons, 3 underscores and 3 semicolons again.
Clearly, we have to divide this message into exactly three crying emoticons, each with a single underscore.
There are 36 different ways to do so.

2)
"_;__;"

Returns: 0

As this message begins with an underscore, it clearly cannot be divided into one or more crying emoticons: each crying emoticon starts with a semicolon.

3)
";_____________________________________;"

Returns: 1



4)
";__;____;"

Returns: 0



5)
";_;;__;_;;"

Returns: 52
