PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a long long n.
You are also given an int k that is a positive integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.

Find and return the smallest m such that:

m is greater than or equal to n
the binary representation of m contains (at least) k consecutive ones


DEFINITION
Class:ConsecutiveOnes
Method:get
Parameters:long long, int
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long get(long long n, int k)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be beween 0 and 2^50 - 1, inclusive.  
-k will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.  


EXAMPLES

0)
1
2

Returns: 3

We want the smallest integer that is at least 1 and contains 2 consecutive ones in binary. Clearly the smallest such integer is 3.

1)
5
2

Returns: 6

The binary representation of the number 5 is 101, which does not contain two consecutive ones.
The next integer is 6, which is 110 in binary. As this does contain two consecutive ones, the correct return value is 6.

2)
7
2

Returns: 7



3)

33

Returns: 364273356242943
