 notes for CP3
 - chapter 3
   - p 92 why sort by right endpoint? How does it helps ?
   - problems
     - Recursive Backtracking (Harder) - 416 - it's solvable by iteration through possible starts [0, 9] because we are looking for continuous sub-sequences only (like {7,6,5} but {7,6,4}). We can do it by backtracking too but that doesn't look natural for me. I would classify it as "two loops" or "binary operations" problem.
     - Involving Sorting (Or The Input Is Already Sorted) - 12210 - A Match Making Problem: solution here is to find the difference (B-S) and minimum element in bachelor ages. We can go without any sorting / greedy here (+code)
     - 196 - Spreadsheet - does not look like DP for me. You just need to "invent" data structure to handle references and that's all
     - 10465 - Homer Simpson - solvable by simple loop (+code)
 - chapter 4
   - p. 134 ure are using "visited" array to mark explored and non-explored vertices. It's a bit confusing to read
     - if (dfs_num[x] == UNVISITED) ...; if (visited[x]) ..
   - p. 187 answer to 4.2.5.2 (data structure wit O(1) insert front/back) what about deque? 
   - p 189 4.5.3.1 -we can do the SCC search on undirected graph too
   - 10596 - problem has kinda weird test cases on OJ (i.e. when we check for connectivity we should only consider vertices that have edges _and_ expecting to see at least one component) - for me problem has low dacu because of that.
 - chapter 5
   - p. 220 problem 11344 we can do with modulo arithmetic instead of remembering div trails
   - p 221 side note 15 "staying..." Is "winning"?
 - chapter 6
   - p. 262 it worth noting that sentinels _could_ be the same (a$b$) but we should check for sentinel in LCP calculation. This is needed for example in 11107 - Life Forms problem when we have a lot of strings to cross-match
 - chapter 9
   - p. 381 listing - second call should be RandomizedSelect(A, q + 1, r, k - q)
 - visualization to max flow min cost?
